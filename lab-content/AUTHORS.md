# SEED Emulator Authors

SEED Emulator is developed by a community of voluntary contributors who
contribute code, bug reports, documentation, artwork, support, etc.

It is impossible to list them all; nevertheless, this file aims at listing
the developers who have made significant contribution to this project.
"Significant" is arbitrarily decided, but should be fair.

GitHub usernames are indicated in parentheses, or as sole entry when no other
name is available.

## Project Founders
```
   Wenliang Du (kevin-w-du)
   Honghao Zeng (magicnat)
```

## Core Developers
```
(in the order of join time)
   Wenliang Du (kevin-w-du)
   Honghao Zeng (magicnat)
   Kyungrok Won (wonkr)
```

To elect a developer into the core team, one of the core team members needs to
make a proposal, presenting the case to the entire core team. The core team
will meet (online) and discuss the case. Eventually, the core team will vote. A
candidate winning at least two third of the votes will be elected. 

The membership of the core team
is not permanent. If a core team member is not actively engaged for a long
period of time, a member can propose to vote him/her out. The same procedure
will be followed, and two third of the votes are needed. 
The founding members cannot be voted out.
