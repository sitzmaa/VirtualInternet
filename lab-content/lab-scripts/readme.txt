This directory holds scripts for launching the internet
emulator along with lab guides for individual labs.

The startbgplab.sh script can be used as a template for
creating more scripts tailored to launch different labs.
In the ~/.bashrc file aliases can be set to run newly created
scripts with ease. New lab guides can be added to:
~/Documents/lab-content/lab-guides
New aliases can be added to the UserManual file.
