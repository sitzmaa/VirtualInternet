Virtual Internet User Manual

On start-up this virtual machine will have a terminal window open; 
inside this terminal you can issue various aliased commands; 
these commands will run scripts to automatically build and launch 
the Virtual Internet Emulator accompanied by a lab guide 
for your desired activity.

Commands For Launching Labs:
- BGP Attack Lab via Network Prefix Hijacking: $ bgplab
- Botnet DDOS Attack Lab: $ botnetlab

Commands For Resolving Docker Errors:
- $ clean
 (In some cases incorrectly built networks will result in
 errors with Docker creating network-overlap issues. Issuing
 this command will run a script to reset Docker.)


**NOTE: Due to some latency issues with the remote nature 
	of the environment and the resources required for
	building 100+ Docker containers, launching the 
	Internet Emulator can take up to 5 minutes after 
	issuing a command to run a startup script.**
